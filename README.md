<h1>Zaccord</h1>
A webshop for selling 3D printed products.

Zaccord is a Hungary-based e-commerce website where users can order a variety of 3D-printed
products or upload their STL files for custom printing & creating lithophanes.<br>
We tried to create a great customer experience by simplifying the process of shopping & eliminating the need to ask for a bid when using our custom print service. This all makes shopping fun and instant.<br><br>
<b>Note:</b> the project is still in development phase but you can check the live product at
<a href="https://www.zaccord.com">zaccord.com</a>.

## Target audience
We aim to make Zaccord available for as many people as we can but currently we are limited
to Hungary. Therefore, only Hungarain citizens and people with a valid Hungarian address are
able to use the service and buy products since shipping is restricted to inland.<br>
Also note that Zaccord is currently only available in Hungarian.

## Technical
The site is written in vanilla Node.js & SQL (MySQL) for managing the database. It uses a handful of libraries for user authentication & security and managing STL files.

## Price calculation formula
It calculates the price of a given product when knowing the base price with the following
default paramaters:
  - 0.20mm layer height
  - 20% infill
  - x1 scale
  - 1.2mm infill thickness
where the pure value of these parameters are substituted into variables in degrees.

Eventually, it provides the desired price intervals for us. You can refine it to your needs by
changing the <i>sine</i> expressions and decimal constants.<br>
Note that due to the nature of the <i>sine</i> function 90% infill provides the highest
price and any infill value above that will produce a smaller price, returning an undesirable outcome at the end. You may need to correct it if you want to use a 91%-100% infill.

## TODOs
Implementing one or more of the following features would be nice:
  - A product review system with 1-5 stars & comments
  - View lithophanes in STL mode (see 3DRocks)
  - A clever algorithm for giving a close enough price estimate for custom printed products &
    lithophanes
  - Anything else you think would be cool...

## Source code
We made this project open source because we want to spread 3D-printed products especially in Hungary & inspire people for trying out new technologies.

## Distributing source code
If you found any bugs or want to contribute to the development of Zaccord as a developer feel free to do it in a pull request.
You can even use it as a reference for creating your project or getting ideas for 3D-printing websites.

## Contributing
If you want to contribute to the development of Zaccord feel free to do it. We are grateful for
anyone who contributes to the project.<br>
In addition, if you implement one or more of the TODOs listed above or significantly contribute
to this project we may send you a free 3D printed product of your choice and we also give you a
chance to join our team and work with us.

## Setting up the project
After cloning the repository & installing Node.js create the database by importing `database.sql` to MySQL.<br>
In `src/js/connectDb.js` configure the parameters for connecting to the database.<br>
To install the dependencies run `npm install`.<br>
To start the project run `node app.js` and the site should be up on port 5000.<br>
If you also want to make the e-mail sending service work you will need to edit the connection parameters to your server in `src/js/includes/sendEmail.js`.<br>
You may also want to edit the secret for sessions in `src/js/includes/createSession.js`.
